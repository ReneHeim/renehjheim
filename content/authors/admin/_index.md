<div style = "text-align: justify">
My research goals are focused on thermal and hyperspectral remote sensing for abiotic and biotic plant stress detection and differentiation. I am driven to investigate links between high dimensional remote sensing data, plant functional properties and plant stress responses in our managed and natural landscapes.
<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that our managed and natural landscapes can, and must, co-exist in a more efficient way. If we understand the various functions and strategies of plants, we can cultivate and protect them at the same time. I am passionate about transparent and interdisciplinary research. To conduct such research, I am trying to create teams and collaborations with experts from various disciplines. To be able to communicate with all of them, I am learning the methods and languages of plant pathology, functional ecology, statistical programming and machine learning.
