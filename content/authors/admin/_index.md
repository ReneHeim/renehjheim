<div style = "text-align: justify">
My studies in Bioengineering and Plant Ecology shaped my interest in inter-disciplinary research. I believe that the most vexing challenges human society faces cannot be solved unilaterally. A key interest is transferring and developing methods in optical remote sensing and applying them in digital disease detection and precision agriculture. With my research, I am hoping to optimize agricultural practices for securing a sustainable and healthy food production while mitigating their environmental impact.
