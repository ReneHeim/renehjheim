Aflatoxins are secondary metabolites of filamentous fungi and one of multiple mycotoxins. They are mainly produced by the species, <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> and <i>A. parasiticus</i> and can have a variety of globally relevant food crops as a host. Aflatoxins are categorized as Group-1 carcinogens, and according to the National Institutes of Health, are responsible for increased risks for liver cancer.
Controlling aflatoxin throughout the food system is challenging and requires a truly integrated systems approach because vulnerability to contamination occurs in various system stages: in-field production, harvest, and storage. In our project, we are looking at options to detect aflatoxins in the field by means of hyperspectral, aerial remote sensing, near-range thermal imaging, disease related functional plant traits and volatile organic compounds.
This project takes a novel approach for detecting and predicting aflatoxin in relevant agronomic food system chains by using a multi-disciplinary approach for accurately assessing and managing aflatoxin vulnerable points.
