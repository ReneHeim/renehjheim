Current processing software of aerial imagery removes the potential for multi-angular observations. Therefore, it is neither possible to correct for directional influences of incoming and outgoing light nor to use the observations from multiple angles as an additional information source for the retrieval of biophysical plant parameters. We are currently studying the potential of UAV-retrieved multi-angular reflectance data for the estimation of LAI and Cab by inversion of the SCOPE (SoilCanopy  Observation,  Photochemistry  and  Energy  fluxes). model.
