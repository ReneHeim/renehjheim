Contemporary agriculture practices are unable to supply a permanently growing population with sufficient food. Globally, one in seven people lack access to food or are chronically malnourished. Drought stress is responsible for more crop loss than any other abiotic or biotic stress. Thus, a critical goal in many breeding programs is to select cultivars that perform efficiently under drought conditions.

<br>
A major and still unresolved challenge for breeding is that a complex combination of biochemical, physiological and structural plant traits is responsible for drought resistance or tolerance. While most studies investigate relevant traits under isolation, our approach is to select for a combination of below and above-ground traits that are naturally controlled by a plant to maintain productivity.
We will also have the opportunity to collect near-range thermal and aerial, hyperspectral imagery to support our plant trait data. The data will be analyzed by utilizing modern deep learning and image processing techniques to develop a proof-of-concept for automated, high throughput drought phenotyping in peanut breeding. Such a concept can increase the selection interval and absolute number of genotypes being screened while providing a reliable, objective and cost-effective method.
