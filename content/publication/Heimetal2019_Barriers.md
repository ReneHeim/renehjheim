abstract: Effective collaboration for generating solutions to complex theoretical or applied problems depends on an individualâ€™s willingness to interact and share knowledge. These traits are especially important when problems are unlikely to be solved within the conceptual framework of a single discipline. The application of remote sensing methods in plant pathology is a good example of such an interdisciplinary approach. In this letter we highlight some barriers that may hamper collaboration between scientists of these two domains and discuss mutually beneficial solutions. While we acknowledge that these barriers and subsequent solutions are likely well known, we hope that identifying them here will start discussion and expedite solutions.
